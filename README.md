# Bookstore_Management_System

The owner of a bookstore has asked for your help designing a system that allows them to keep track of the store’s inventory and members.  The owner provides you with the following details about what the store offers:
The store sells three types of products: books, CDs, and DVDs.
The store offers two types of memberships to customers: regular memberships and premium memberships. The regular membership is free, while the premium members pay a fee every month.
The store keeps track of payment method for their premium members and whether the monthly fee is due or has been paid.
The system should keep track of the members and how much money each has spent at the store regardless if they are regular or premium members.
The system also keeps track of the inventory of each product.
