# Resource_Management_System

You should create your own management game. In this type of game, users are given a quantity of one or more resources, and then they need to make good decisions about how to allocate those resources. Often there will be ways of spending some resources to gain more resources on later terms. For example, use some wood now to build a lumber mill so that you have more wood later. Usually, some resources would be consumed with each round (often representing a day or a year), and random events might occur that would harm or benefit the player, such as a quantity of stone being lost.
