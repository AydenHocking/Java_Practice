# Resource_Management_System

Change the way our ordering system works. Alter the execution of your FastFoodKitchen such that rather than using a fixed order list when run, the orders will be created by parsing through an external file at execution time.
Once your orders are populated, the program should proceed as before. When the day ends (i.e., user selects exit), the following should happen:
An end of day report should be generated as a .txt file. 
This file should include what orders were placed and whether they were completed or not. The file should also include totals for each item sold (number of hamburgers, number of cheeseburgers,...).  You can include any other information you think is relevant.
It is up to you to figure out the proper formatting to this file. It should be clear, readable, and make sense.
An updated orders file. This file should follow the same format of the input file , but have any orders that remain to be completed. This file should have a slightly different name, such as burgerOrders2.csv.
